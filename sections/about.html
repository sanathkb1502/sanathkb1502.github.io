            <h2>About</h2>
            <p align="justify">I am a data professional with a strong educational background and over three years of
                experience in the field. I am graduate student at SUNY Stony Brook, where I honed my
                skills in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning through a combination of rigorous
                coursework and
                hands-on projects. Throughout my career, I have excelled in leveraging cloud technologies to
                streamline ETL
                processes and optimize data processing for seamless deployment, consistently delivering
                production-ready
                projects on time. My expertise extends to database schema modeling and design, encompassing both
                relational
                databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB and
                Cassandra.
                I am proficient in implementing ETL processes using tools like AWS services, SSIS and Apache Airflow
                and
                Snowflake services.
                <br>
                <br> Python is my go-to language for backend configurations, data manipulations/transformations and
                workflow
                automation, supported by libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn,
                as well
                as Plotly for data visualization. I have successfully managed projects using industry-standard tools
                like
                Jira, GitLab, Miro, and Confluence, fostering seamless collaboration. My skills also extend to data
                streaming using PySpark, Kafka, and Apache Airflow, as well as a demonstrated proficiency in big
                data
                technologies like Hadoop, Hive, and Sqoop. I take pride in my ability in managing my team and mentor
                them,
                promote continuous learning, and uphold high standards in data engineering practices. Additionally,
                I excel
                in data migration, cleansing, and profiling, ensuring data accuracy and quality throughout the data
                warehousing process.
